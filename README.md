# AI-Class-Programs
These are all the programs I wrote in my Artificial Intelligence course at American University

Ross Bollinger Assignment 2.pl: A program written in prolog that is meant to solve the traveling salesmen problem with specific constraints
involving transportation methods and costs.

Assignment 3 Steps 1 and 2.py: A python program that uses the nltk library (a library used specifically for natural language processing)
that is meant to accomplish two things:
  1. Get ten Shakespearean plays (five comedies, five tragedies), process the words (i.e. remove stop words, remove punctuation, etc.)
     for use with the Bag of Words model, then take the fifty most frequently occuring words in the comedies and the same for the tragedies.
     These lists were then used to generate two word clouds: one for comedy and one for tragedy. These word clouds are in the Word Clouds
     folder.
  2. Take a speech made by Dumbledore in Harry Potter and turn it into a parse tree based on pre-defined grammar rules.

Assignment 3 Step 3.py: A python program that takes the same Shakesperian plays used in the Steps 1 and 2 program and generates 100-word
-long sentences of Shakespearean "gibberish" using a bigram model.

Ross Bollinger Assignment 3 Reflections.docx: This is just a series of reflections I wrote about writing the programs associated with
assignment 3. The end of the document is the only thing of note since it provides examples of the "gibberish" created by the Step 3 program.

Word Clouds: This folder contains two .png files. Each are word clouds created by an online word cloud generator using the frequent word
lists created by the Assignment 3 Steps 1 and 2 program.
